# üìñ About Me
<!-- ÊàëÊ≠£Âú®ÂØªÊâæÊó∂Á©∫Êï∞ÊçÆÊåñÊéòÊñπÂêëÁöÑPHDËÅå‰Ωç -->
Hello! I'm Guangyu Wang (ÁéãÂπøÂÆá), an undergraduate student majoring in Data Science and Big Data Technology at Dongbei University of Finance and Economics, expected to graduate in July 2026. I am currently conducting research as a student member at the Key Laboratory of Big Data Management Optimization and Decision.

I am passionate about all forms of computer technology. I have compiled Android 6.0 system source code from scratch and maintain a personal NAS server with 80TB of storage capacity.
